New ABCDE page https://abcde.einval.com/wiki/

The old ABCDE examples that weren't available (I think) last time I looked into it http://www.andrews-corner.org/linux/abcde/index.html

The same guy provided info on how to include album art! http://www.andrews-corner.org/linux/abcde/getalbumart.html

==========
Ideas
* Do IMDB lookup (or require IMDB URI).  Then, grab metadata from it.
* Do TheTVDB lookup (or require TheTVDB URI).  Then, grab metadata from it.
* Find a resource that knows what all media is on a DVD, with naming, so I don't
  need to name things.  (meaning, I can know that Title 2 is a bonus feature
  named "Making of xyz movie")
* Re-transcode every DVD to grab DVD extras--extra audio tracks and non-movie
  media.
* Figure out abcde album art, as well as how to get the album art into the .ogg
  files.
* Re-think the directory structures--how to do the off-site backups, especially.
